# Contribution of nosocomial transmission to *Klebsiella pneumoniae* neonatal sepsis in Africa and South Asia: a meta-analysis of infection clusters inferred from pathogen genomics and temporal data  

This repository includes data and code from the above-titled paper (Odih et al, 2025, MedRxiv). 

[Article/preprint](#)

Input data are available in `data/`, and all figures and tables from the paper are available in `figures/` and `tables/`. 

All code to analyse the data and generate the figures and tables are in `analyses.Rmd`.

The analysis requires imported code from the [Transmission Estimator](https://github.com/klebgenomics/transmission_estimator/) tool to detect transmission clusters and estimate proportion of cases attributable to transmission.
